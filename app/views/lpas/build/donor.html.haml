          %p The 'donor' is the person making this LPA and appointing other people to make decisions on their behalf. The donor:
          %ul
            %li must be 18 or over
            %li must be able to make their own decisions when they create the LPA â€“ this is known as having mental capacity
          %p Only the donor can make decisions about their LPA and the people to involve.
