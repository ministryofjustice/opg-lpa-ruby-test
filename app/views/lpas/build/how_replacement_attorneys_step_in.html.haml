              %p You can choose when your replacement attorneys step in, and in what order.
              %p Your replacement attorneys will usually all step in together as soon as 1 of your original attorneys can no longer act. They will be able to make any decision jointly and severally along with the other original attorneys.
              %p If you'd rather they stepped in later, or you want to choose a specific order, then select 1 of the other 2 options.
