          %ul
            %li You can have 1 or more attorneys
            %li Attorneys must be 18 or over
            %li Attorneys must have mental capacity â€“ the ability to make decisions
          %p The most important thing is that your attorneys are people you trust to respect your wishes and act in your best interests.
          %p There are some other things you must know and consider before you decide.
