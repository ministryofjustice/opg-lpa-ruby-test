      %p That's all we need for the LPA itself. Now it's ready to print and sign.
      %p After it's signed, you'll need to log back in here to complete a registration form and pay the application fee.
      %p Everything's been saved, so you can pause here to arrange things and talk to the people involved in your LPA. We've emailed you a link that you can follow whenever you're ready to register, or just sign back in to this account.

          %h3 Register the LPA
          %p After everyone’s signed the LPA, you have to pay an application fee, then send the signed LPA along with a completed registration form to the Office of the Public Guardian. It’s a good idea to apply to register your LPA straight after making it. An unregistered LPA can't be used.
