# Life-sustaining treatment

Life-sustaining treatment is **only** relevant to health and welfare LPAs. 

Your health and welfare LPA lets you decide in advance what you want to happen if you need life-sustaining treatment **when you don't have mental capacity**. 

You have 2 options: 

* Option A: **Yes. I want to give my attorneys authority** to give or refuse consent to life-sustaining treatment on my behalf 
* Option B: **No. I donâ€™t want to give my attorneys authority** to give or refuse consent to life-sustaining treatment on my behalf

If you choose Option B, your doctors will make decisions about life-sustaining treatment. 

After you print out your LPA document, you'll have to **sign and date** the option you've chosen. This must be witnessed. 

Your decision here may **take the place of any other advance decisions** you've made about life-sustaining treatment. An advance decision is a legally binding document that allows you to specify particular types of treatment that you don't want to receive, in case you don't have the capacity to make this decision for yourself at some point. Visit the NHS Choices website to <a href="http://www.nhs.uk/Planners/end-of-life-care/Pages/advance-decision-to-refuse-treatment.aspx" rel="external" target="_blank">learn more about advance decisions.</a>

**It is especially crucial you trust the people you appoint as attorneys** and believe they will act in your best interests if they are to decide whether or not you have life-sustaining treatment.

See our [Attorneys](#/help/attorneys) help topic for more information on choosing attorneys.


## What is life-sustaining treatment?

A life-sustaining treatment is a treatment that a doctor believes is necessary to keep a patient alive. 

Life-sustaining treatments might include:

* a serious surgical operation, like a heart bypass
* chemotherapy, radiotherapy or another cancer treatment
* an organ transplant
* artificial nutrition or hydration (food or water given other than by mouth)

Whether or not a treatment is life-sustaining depends on the situation. For example, if someone had breathing problems and developed pneumonia, then a simple course of antibiotics could be regarded as life-sustaining.

Decisions about life-sustaining treatment might be needed in a variety of circumstances. One example is routine surgery where something unexpected happens. 

## Who decides? 

You choose who decides. 

You say in your health and welfare LPA if you want your attorneys to make decisions about whether or not you receive life-sustaining treatment, if you don't have the mental capacity to make those decisions yourself.

Your attorneys can **only** make decisions about life-sustaining treatment if you choose Option A. 

If you choose Option B, your doctors will decide about life-sustaining treatment for you.

### Can I give my attorneys instructions about what to do if I need life-sustaining treatment?

You can set restrictions and give guidance about your personal preferences, so that any decision they make would be as close as possible to the decision you would have made for yourself.

You can specify medical or physical conditions where your attorneys must or must not consent to life-sustaining treatment on your behalf. For example, you might choose to state that your attorneys must not consent to life-sustaining treatment if you are in a persistent vegetative state.

At the end of the LPA tool there is a section where you can add restrictions and guidance for your attorneys. If you have specific wishes regarding life-sustaining treatment, make them clear in that section. 

Read our [Restrictions and guidance](#/help/restrictions-and-guidance) help topic to find out more about giving guidance to your attorneys.



### What if I want my doctors to make the decision?

If you choose Option B, your doctors will make the decision. If the situation arises, they must:

* carry out an assessment of your best interests
* take into account, where possible, the views of your attorneys and other people involved in your welfare
* take into account any written or oral statement you may have made, including any guidance you've given in your LPA

Ways to make your views known about kinds of treatment you do and do not want include **statements of preference, care plans** and **advance decisions to refuse treatment**. Read our help topic on [The 2 types of LPA](#/help/the-2-types-of-lpa) for more on this. 

If you've made an **advance decision** and you want your attorneys or doctors to take it into account, you'll have the opportunity to refer to it when adding 'extra instructions' under the 'restrictions and conditions' section of this LPA tool. You'll also need to include a copy of the decision when you send the LPA to be registered. 

There's more about life-sustaining treatment, advance decisions and how medical professionals must respond to your written wishes in chapter 9 of the <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/protecting-the-vulnerable/mental-capacity-act" rel="external" target="_blank">Mental Capacity Act 2005 Code of Practice</a>.
