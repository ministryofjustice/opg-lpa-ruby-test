# How attorneys make decisions

If you've chosen  more than 1 attorney or more than 1 replacement attorney, you must decide whether you want them to make some or all decisions **on their own** or whether they should **agree some or all decisions unanimously**. The legal terms used are **severally** and **jointly**.

Your 3 options are:

**Jointly and severally**
> Your attorneys can make decisions on your behalf **on their own or together**

**Jointly**
> Your attorneys **must always agree unanimously** on every decision they make on your behalf. If 1 of your attorneys dies or can no longer act, the other attorneys won't be able to make decisions any more.

**Jointly for some decisions, and jointly and severally for other decisions**
> Your attorneys must agree unanimously on some decisions, but can make others on their own. You say which decisions they have to agree together. If 1 of your attorneys dies or can no longer act, the other attorneys won't be able to make the joint decisions any more.

Most people choose **jointly and severally** because it is the most **flexible and practical** way for attorneys to make decisions.

But whatever way you appoint your attorneys to act, they must always act in your best interests and make every effort to find out whether you can make a decision yourself.

There is information about each of the choices below. However, if you are not sure which option is best for your circumstances then you may want to get legal advice.

## Attorneys acting jointly and severally (either together or individually)

Your attorneys can make **any decisions together or any decisions on their own**. An action taken by any attorney alone is as valid as if they were the only attorney. It's up to your attorneys to choose how they make decisions, but the way they act must always be in your best interests.

Most people choose this option. Attorneys have the flexibility to make simple or urgent decisions quickly and easily, and if one of the attorneys dies or can no longer act, the LPA won't be cancelled.

Because of this flexibility it would be possible for a single attorney to make decisions for you without discussing them with your other attorneys. However, if you didn't have mental capacity and there was disagreement about a decision that your attorneys couldn't resolve, the matter could be referred to the Court of Protection.

If you choose this option you **must not say anywhere else** in the LPA that certain decisions **must** be made by:

* 1 particular attorney
* both or all of your attorneys
* a minimum number of attorneys

You must not say anything else that restricts the way attorneys choose to act.

It will be up to the attorneys to decide who will make any decisions, although **you can make suggestions** in the guidance section of your LPA.

## Attorneys acting jointly (agreeing every decision unanimously)

Attorneys appointed jointly must **always make all decisions together**. They must **all agree unanimously on all decisions** and they must all sign any relevant documents.

You might choose this option if you want to make sure that your attorneys all agree on every decision, regardless of how large or small it is. **But they must all agree.** If they can't all agree on a decision, then that decision can't be made on your behalf without going to court.

If you choose this option:

* **some simple decisions might be delayed** because it takes time to get the attorneys together
* if your attorneys cannot work together for some reason, **your LPA may be cancelled**
* if 1 of your attorneys dies or can no longer act, your LPA will be cancelled unless you have appointed a **replacement attorney**

It's a good idea to **appoint a replacement attorney or attorneys** if you choose this option.

**Note:** If 1 of your original attorneys can no longer act on your behalf, your replacement attorneys will replace **all your original attorneys**. This is because the law sees attorneys acting jointly as a single unit.

## Attorneys acting jointly for some decisions, and jointly and severally for other decisions

Your **attorneys must make certain decisions together** and agree them unanimously, but **they can also make other decisions individually**. You decide which decisions your attorneys must make and agree together.

If you choose this option you must **clearly state which decisions your attorneys should make together** and agree unanimously â€“ that is, **when they should act jointly**. There are some examples below showing how you can do this.

You might choose this option if you are happy for your attorneys to make day-to-day decisions on their own but want them to agree on bigger things, such as selling a house, or deciding where you should live.

If you choose this option:

* if 1 of your original attorneys can no longer act on your behalf, the remaining attorneys will **not be able to make any of the joint decisions**

* if you have appointed a replacement attorney, they will be able to make the joint decisions instead of the original attorneys


### Examples of working jointly for some decisions, and jointly and severally for others

Here are some examples of instructions about acting jointly for some decisions that might be included in a **property and financial affairs LPA**:

> My attorneys must act jointly in relation to decisions about selling or letting my house and may act jointly and severally for everything else.

> My attorneys must act jointly in relation to decisions about investments in stocks and shares and may act jointly and severally for everything else.

In the first example, 'everything else' includes all financial decisions except the one specifically described.
In the second example 'everything else' includes any type of financial transaction that is not an investment in stocks and shares.

Here are some examples that might be included in a **health and welfare LPA**:

> My attorneys must act jointly in relation to decisions about where I live and may act jointly and severally for everything else.

> My attorneys must act jointly in relation to decisions I have authorised them to make about life-sustaining treatment and may act jointly and severally for everything else.

In both examples 'everything else' covers all decisions about your day-to-day care and medical treatment except the ones specifically described.

### Questions to ask yourself
* Do I **fully trust each of my attorneys** to make decisions in my best interests? If not, are these the right attorneys?
* Do my attorneys know what **I would decide** in the same situations?
* Are there any **practical obstacles** to my attorneys working effectively together?
* Do my attorneys get on? What would happen if they fell out?
* Even if my attorneys can make most decisions on their own, are there **some big decisions** I want them to agree on? If so, what are they?
* Do I want my attorneys or replacement attorneys to make all their decisions together and agree **everything** unanimously?
* Am I happy for my attorneys to choose for themselves whether they make decisions together or individually?
* Do my attorneys understand how I would like them to make decisions?
* Do I understand **what will happen if one of my attorneys can't act any more**?
* **Do I want replacement attorneys?** This is an important back-up if attorneys have to make some or all decisions together.
