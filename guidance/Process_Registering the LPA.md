# Registering the LPA

Once you have filled in and printed the LPA document, and everyone involved has signed it, you can apply to register it. You do this by paying the application fee and sending the LPA to us along with a registration form. You’ll be able to pay the fee and generate the form using this site.

Please don't make any changes to the LPA document after you've signed it. That could make it invalid, so you'd have to print it again and get everyone to sign it again.

Before you register, we need to ask you a few questions about things like signing and notification dates to make sure everything is correct.

Once that's all settled, you can pay the application fee online or by cheque. If you receive certain benefits or have a low income, you may be eligible for a reduction or exemption – there's more information under our [Fees and reductions](/help/#topic-fees-and-reductions) help topic.

Once you've paid, print the registration form – the tool will have automatically filled it in for you – and sign it.

Send this **registration form** with your **signed LPA document** to us at the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG).

We'll register the LPA and send it back to you. This takes a minimum of 4 weeks.

## Why you should register your LPA

Your attorneys can **only** use your LPA to make decisions on your behalf after we – OPG – have registered it and returned it to you officially stamped.

You don't have to register an LPA as soon as you've filled it in and signed it, but it is a good idea to do so just in case it contains any errors that you need to correct. If there are any errors, you may have to make all or part of the LPA again. You can only do that if you still have mental capacity.

If your attorneys **apply to register the LPA when you don't have mental capacity**, then you won't be allowed to correct any errors. The LPA won't be registered and **cannot be used**. Your attorneys – or someone else – will have to apply to the Court of Protection to get the power to make decisions on your behalf or receive a declaration that the LPA can be treated as valid. This can be a long process and may cost a lot more than an LPA.

### The information you'll need to fill in

This registration tool will ask you for the following:

* **who is applying to register the LPA:** either the donor, 1 or more of the attorneys who can act severally or joint attorneys can apply to register the LPA
* **correspondence address:** enter details of the person who should receive any correspondence from us while we process your application
* **the dates the LPA was signed:** the dates on which all the relevant people – you, the attorneys and the certificate provider – signed the printed LPA document
* **the dates you notified your 'people to be told':** if you named 'people to be told' when making your LPA, then you must send them the notification forms before you apply to register
* **other powers of attorney:** enter details of any other enduring power of attorney or registered lasting power of attorney that you've made as a donor

The rest of the details will have been completed automatically for you during the application process.

### Print it, sign it and send it

Once you've filled everything in, print out the registration form and sign it.

Send the following documents to OPG:

* **the signed LPA document**. You must **include pages 1 and 2**, which are important parts of the form, and **any continuation sheets** that have been printed and signed
* **the signed 'Application to register a lasting power of attorney' form**. You can download this when you have answered the questions

If you want to apply for a reduction of or exemption from application fees, you should also include:

* the signed 'Application for exemption or remission of EPA/LPA application to register fees' form. You can download this at the same time as you download the application to register form
* evidence of your eligibility for exemption or reduction of fees

Find out about [Fees and reductions](/help/#topic-fees-and-reductions) and whether you qualify.

### What happens once we receive your LPA?

If the donor is applying to register the LPA, we'll formally notify the attorneys of the application; if an attorney is applying, we'll notify the donor (and the other attorneys, if applicable).

We then process the LPA and hold it for at least 4 weeks.

The 4-week waiting period is set by law. It gives people involved in the LPA time to raise any concerns they might have about it. For example, if they think that you're being forced into making it or that someone has tried to commit a fraud.

We also use the time to check that the LPA has been made correctly and make sure that there's nothing that would make it invalid or unworkable. If there is something that must be corrected before it can be registered, we'll contact you.
