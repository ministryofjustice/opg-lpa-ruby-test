# Donor

The donor is **the person who is making the LPA** and the person it will apply to, if they don't have mental capacity in the future.

### What is mental capacity?

'Mental capacity' refers to **the ability to make a decision**. A person with mental capacity has at least a general understanding of the decision they need to make, why they need to make it, and the likely consequences. Sometimes people can make some kinds of decision, but don't have the mental capacity to make others.

An LPA is a powerful legal document that allows you, the donor, to choose others – known as your attorneys – to make decisions on your behalf. You can make an LPA to cover your property and financial affairs, or your health and welfare. Some people choose to make both.

**Only you can give others the power to make decisions** on your behalf. This applies whether you get help in making your LPA or not.

## Who can be a donor?
An LPA is for one person only. You can make an LPA if:

* you are at least 18 years old
* you have the mental capacity to do so

It's fine to get help when making your LPA. Many people talk to family, friends or a legal advisor. But **decisions about your LPA must ultimately be your own**. For example, no one else should choose your attorneys for you.

Most people with mental capacity can make an LPA. However, there could be complications if either of the following apply:

* **Residency issues** – you live or have property outside of England and Wales
* **Bankruptcy issues** – you are bankrupt or subject to a debt relief order and want to make an LPA for your property and financial affairs

Lots of people still make LPAs in these circumstances. Just make sure you understand the rules and limitations, as they could seriously affect or even invalidate your LPA. If in doubt **you may want to get legal advice**.

### Residency and property

LPAs cover people who live or have assets in England and Wales. So an LPA made here may not apply in other countries, including Scotland and Northern Ireland. You should therefore think about getting legal advice if:

* you live outside England and Wales
* you have property outside England and Wales
* you're planning to move away from England and Wales
* there are other reasons why where you live complicates your situation

### Bankruptcy and debt relief orders

**Bankruptcy does not affect a health and welfare LPA**.

There are some rules about bankruptcy and debt relief orders for a property and financial affairs LPA.

**If you are bankrupt** or subject to a debt relief order you can make and sign a property and financial affairs LPA, and it can be registered. However, your **attorneys will not have power over all of your property**. If this applies to you, you should think about getting legal advice before you make your LPA.

Please note, **if you become bankrupt** or subject to a debt relief order after your property and financial affairs LPA is made or registered it will be cancelled. See our [Attorneys](#/help/attorneys) help topic to find out what could happen if an attorney becomes bankrupt or subject to a debt relief order.


## Choosing attorneys
Your choice of attorney or attorneys is a very important one. Attorneys should be **trusted people who are capable of acting** in your best interests.

Make sure you give yourself plenty of time to think about who you want as your attorneys, and that you pick the people who are best for you.

## Other names
If you use more than one name, or used to be known by a different name, it's a good idea to make a list of these. This will help your attorneys deal with banks and other organisations on your behalf if your LPA is used.
