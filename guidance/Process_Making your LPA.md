# Making your LPA

You can use this tool to fill out and print a lasting power of attorney document. The document must then be signed by all the parties involved. You must register the LPA with us – the Office of the Public Guardian – before it can be used.

There's a £110 application fee for each LPA that you register. You can pay the fee on this website and then post all the forms to us. We check the LPA and if there are any problems,  we come back to you and try to clear them up. Once everything's okay, we register it and post it back to you. It's then ready to use. 

You don't have to register an LPA as soon as you complete it, but **it's a good idea to register early**, just in case it contains errors. You'll only be able to correct the errors if you still have mental capacity.
