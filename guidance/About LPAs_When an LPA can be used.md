# When an LPA can be used

A health and welfare LPA takes effect after registration, and only **when you don't have mental capacity** to make decisions. Your attorneys can't make decisions on your behalf before this point.

### What is mental capacity?
Mental capacity is a person's capacity to make a particular decision at the time it needs to be made. To find out more about  mental capacity, look at the <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/protecting-the-vulnerable/mental-capacity-act" rel="external" target="_blank">Mental Capacity Act 2005 Code of Practice</a>.

However, a property and financial affairs LPA is different. It usually takes effect **when it is registered**. Once we've sent the LPA back to you, your attorneys can make financial decisions on your behalf, **but only if you agree they can do so**.  

You don't have to register an LPA as soon as you've filled it in and signed it, but it's a sensible idea to do so. It means you can catch any errors early. It can be complicated and expensive for you or your attorneys to deal with problems further down the line – especially if you then don't have mental capacity to correct errors.  


### Choosing when your property and financial affairs LPA should begin

A property and financial affairs LPA usually comes into effect when it's registered:

* **while you have mental capacity** you decide whether your attorneys should act on your behalf and in what circumstances

* **if at some stage you don't have mental capacity** your attorneys can act to make decisions on your behalf

However, you can choose for your property and financial affairs LPA to take effect **only when you don't have mental capacity**. Your attorneys **will not be able to act** for you as long as you still have mental capacity. 

The LPA tool lets you say when your LPA can be used. You can choose 'as soon as it's registered' or 'only once I don't have mental capacity'.

### Why choose 'as soon as it's registered'?

You should choose this option if:

* you want your attorneys to be able to act under the LPA as soon as it is registered

or

* you don't want your attorneys to act straight away, but you do like the security of knowing the LPA is ready to be used if the need arises

For many donors, it's useful to have attorneys help them while they still have mental capacity but **find it difficult or impractical to get things done for some other reason**. For example, if you have a disability and find it hard to get out and about or tricky to communicate with your bank or gas supplier, you may want your attorneys to help you with these things.

As long as you have the capacity to make decisions yourself, you have complete control over your property and financial affairs. You just agree with your attorneys that they can make certain decisions for you. For example, you may ask them to **pay bills and deal with the bank**, but not allow them to make decisions about selling your house. 

Alternatively you can choose not to allow them to use the LPA at all while you are still able to make decisions for yourself.

### Why choose 'only if I don't have mental capacity'?

You might prefer this option if:

* you do not want or need your attorneys to make decisions on your behalf while you can make them yourself
* you want the security of having the LPA registered and ready to use in case you don't have mental capacity in the future.

If you choose this option, once you've filled in the rest of your information, the following words will appear in the restrictions and guidance section of the LPA document you print out:

> I would like my LPA to take effect only when I don't have capacity to make decisions about my property and financial affairs.

You can add to the wording to include more detailed instructions if you prefer. Some people find it helpful to set out how their mental capacity should be assessed. For example, you might say:

> My attorneys shall only act under this power if they have obtained a written medical opinion stating that I am no longer mentally capable of managing and administering my property and financial affairs.

or:

> This lasting power of attorney only applies if my GP or another doctor confirms in writing that I don't have capacity to make specific decisions about property or finances.

When you reach the 'Restrictions and guidance' section in this LPA tool, you can add to the text there if you want restrictions such as the above. 

Alternatively you may trust your attorneys to carry out a good assessment of your mental capacity, in which case you do not need to change the wording.

**Note:** Banks and other financial institutions sometimes wish to see written confirmation that a donor does not have mental capacity before recognising an attorney's authority to act under the LPA.


### Questions to ask yourself

* **Do I need help now** in making decisions about some or all of my property and financial affairs? (If so, 'As soon as it is registered' might suit you)
* Even though I don't need help now, **might I need help in future** in making decisions about some or all of my property and financial affairs while I still have mental capacity? (If so, consider choosing 'As soon as it is registered'.)
* Do I **only** want my attorneys to act on my behalf when I no longer have the mental capacity to make my own decisions? (If so, choose 'Only if I don't have mental capacity')
* Do I want to include **more detailed instructions**  – for instance, about how my mental capacity should be assessed? (If so, you can do this later in the tool. When you reach the step that asks if you'd like to add extra instructions for your attorneys, explain how you must be assessed in the 'Restrictions' subsection.)
