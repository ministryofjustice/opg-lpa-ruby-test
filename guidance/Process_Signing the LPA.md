# Signing the LPA

**It is essential that the people involved in the LPA sign it in the correct order.** If the relevant people do not sign it **in the correct order**, it won't be registered and your attorneys will not be able to use it.

### Order for signing the LPA

**The donor**

The donor must sign the LPA first. This must be witnessed.  The donor should also sign any **continuation sheets** that are numbered A1 or A2. If making a health and welfare LPA, the donor also signs the statement about **life-sustaining treatment** on page 6 of the LPA.

If the donor can't sign the document, there will be an extra sheet with the LPA – continuation sheet A3 – that must be signed on their behalf. The person who signs it must do so in the presence of the donor and at their direction. Two witnesses must be present when it is signed.


**The certificate provider(s)**

The certificate provider(s) sign it next.  If there are 2 certificate providers, the second will be signing a continuation sheet that follows the body of the LPA. The certificate providers should sign as soon as possible after the donor, and within a year of the donor signing. Certificate providers can sign in any order as long as they do so on the same day as or later than the donor.

**The attorneys and any replacement attorneys**

Attorneys and replacement attorneys then sign your LPA. Their signatures must be witnessed.  They should sign as soon as possible after the certificate providers, and within a year of the certificate providers. If you have appointed more than one attorney or replacement attorney, their signatures can be in any order as long as they are on the same day as or later than the certificate providers'.


### Witnesses

You must have a witness who is 18 or over for the donor’s and attorneys’ signatures. You don’t have to use the same witness for all signatures. Each witness must also sign the LPA document.

* **An attorney or replacement attorney can’t be a witness for the donor**. Nor can the employee of any trust corporation named as an attorney or replacement attorney.

* **You, the donor, can't be a witness for your attorneys' signatures**.

The certificate providers and ‘people to be told’ can be witnesses. Attorneys can also witness each other’s signature.


### Confirming the dates
You'll need to confirm the order of signing when you apply to register the LPA using this digital tool. It will ask for the signing dates of the donor, certificate providers and attorneys.

If you notice that the dates are not in the correct order, then you have to print out the document again and have the relevant people sign it in the correct order before you attempt to register the LPA.
