# The 2 types of LPA

There are 2 types of LPA. Some people choose to make 1 of these, while others prefer to make both. You can have different attorneys for each type.

Choose an LPA for **property and financial affairs** if you need help making decisions about money and property. You don't have to own your own home or have a lot of money for this to be relevant. For example, you will probably need people to pay your gas bill or manage your bank account if you become unable to do these things for yourself.

Choose an LPA for **health and welfare** if you'll need someone to make decisions about your medical, physical and personal care. This type of LPA also lets you give them the power to make decisions about treatment to keep you alive or, alternatively, you can say that your doctors should be responsible for these decisions.

### How does a property and financial affairs LPA work?

You choose someone to make decisions on your behalf about things like:

* opening, closing and operating your bank or building society accounts
* claiming, receiving and using your benefits, pensions and allowances
* paying household and other bills
* buying and selling your house and other property

You can also make a separate LPA for your business affairs if you want different people to make those decisions.

Once your LPA is registered it is ready to use immediately (with your consent), unless you've said otherwise. This can allow your attorneys to help you manage your affairs while you still have mental capacity but for some other reason find it difficult or impractical to take care of them yourself.

###How does a health and welfare LPA work?

You choose someone to make decisions on your behalf about things like:

* giving or refusing consent to particular types of healthcare, including medical treatments
* you staying in your own home, and perhaps getting help and support from social services
* whether you move into residential care, and finding the right care home for you
* day-to-day issues such as your diet, dress or daily routine

You must also choose whether the people you appoint are allowed to make decisions about treatment necessary to keep you alive, or whether you would prefer such decisions to be made by your doctors. This is known as 'life-sustaining treatment'.

**A health and welfare LPA can only be used when you don't have the mental capacity to make decisions.** This is an important safeguard for you.

## Other ways to plan for your health and welfare

There are other ways to make your views known and help other people make decisions about your health and welfare.

* You can **write a statement of your preferences** and wishes. It won't be legally binding, but the people looking after you have to take what you say into account when they decide about your best interests.
* You can **create a care plan** if you receive health or social care services. This is a written document stating the type (and frequency) of long-term care services.
* You can **make an advance decision to refuse treatment**. This is a legally binding document that allows you to specify particular types of treatment that you don't want to receive, in case you don't have the capacity to make this decision for yourself at some point.

If you've made an advance decision you can still make an LPA. If you want the advance decision to be taken into account, then you should refer to it when you have the opportunity to 'add extra instructions' in the restrictions and conditions section of your LPA. Then send a copy of your advance decision to OPG when you apply to register.

When making a health and welfare LPA, you'll have to decide whether your attorneys or your doctors should make decisions about life-sustaining treatment. This could take the place of **previous advance decisions**.
