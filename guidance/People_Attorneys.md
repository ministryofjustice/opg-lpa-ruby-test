# Attorneys
Attorneys are **people you trust and appoint under your LPA to make decisions on your behalf** in the event that you don't have mental capacity.

You must have at least one attorney, and there's no upper limit. Remember, though, that **too many attorneys could make things difficult** in practice, as they'll need to work together.

You'll also need to think about replacement attorneys â€“ people who step in if one of your original attorneys can no longer act. So take a look at our [Replacement attorneys](#/help/replacement-attorneys) help topic too.

## Who can be an attorney?
In legal terms, an 'attorney' is a person who's allowed to act on behalf of someone, but **attorneys don't need to be solicitors**. Many people choose family members, friends and other trusted individuals with no legal background. If an attorney is not a professional, the important thing is that you know each other well and that they are **someone who will respect your views and act in your best interests**.

In general you can ask anyone with mental capacity aged 18 or over to be your attorney, including:

* your spouse, civil partner or partner
* a member of your family
* a close friend
* a professional, such as a solicitor

**Note:** If you choose your spouse or civil partner and at some point the relationship is legally ended, they will have to stop being your attorney. Your LPA may be cancelled, unless you've said in your restrictions that they can continue to act as your attorney in these circumstances.

There are also a few rules about attorneys that depend on the type of LPA you're making.

### Property and financial affairs
**An undischarged bankrupt** or a person subject to a debt relief order **can't be an attorney for a property and financial affairs LPA**. If an attorney becomes bankrupt or subject to a debt relief order after the LPA has been registered, they will no longer be able to act.

**Bankruptcy and debt relief orders don't affect health and welfare LPAs.**

If you appoint a professional attorney, such as a solicitor, for a property and financial affairs LPA you must name an individual. **You can't give a job title or the name of a firm**. Professional attorneys usually charge fees.

**A trust corporation can also be your attorney** for a property and financial affairs LPA. These are generally used by people with complex financial affairs, or those who don't have anyone else they want to appoint.

### What is a trust corporation?

A trust corporation manages your funds (savings, pensions, investments and so on). A trust corporation is usually run by a commercial bank or firm of solicitors. If you're considering this route you should seek legal or financial advice.

If you appoint a trust corporation, make sure you use the exact name they operate under in your LPA. Please note that you can't appoint more than 1 trust corporation under your LPA.

### Health and welfare
An attorney for a health and welfare LPA must be an individual, although you can have as many as you need. Make sure each person agrees to be your attorney before you name them in your LPA.

## When attorneys can act
Your LPA can only be used once it's been registered with the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG). In addition, there are different rules about when attorneys can start making decisions on your behalf, depending on:

* the type of LPA you have
* whether you still have the mental capacity to make decisions

### What is mental capacity?

'Mental capacity' refers to **the ability to make a decision**. A person with mental capacity has at least a general understanding of the decision they need to make, why they need to make it, and the likely consequences. Sometimes people can make some kinds of decision, but don't have the mental capacity to make others.

See our help topic [When an LPA can be used](#/help/when-an-lpa-can-be-used), which explains the different rules for the 2 types of LPA.

## When attorneys can no longer act
An attorney can no longer act on your behalf if they:

* die
* lose mental capacity
* decide they can permanently no longer act (known as 'disclaiming their appointment')
* were your spouse or civil partner, but that relationship has legally ended and there were no arrangements for this in your LPA
* become bankrupt or subject to a debt relief order and were an attorney for a property and financial affairs LPA

Depending on how many attorneys you have, and how you've said they can act, your LPA could be unworkable if you lose an attorney.

To protect your LPA you should also **consider appointing replacement attorneys**.

As you would expect, if you cancel your LPA then your attorneys can no longer act on your behalf.

### Concerns about attorneys

OPG doesn't supervise attorneys. If someone believes your attorneys are not acting in your best interests they can raise concerns with OPG. Depending on the circumstances, we may then investigate their actions and decisions. Other organisations, such as the police or social services, may also investigate.

### Questions to ask yourself

It's very important that you choose the best person or people to act as attorney. Most donors take some time over this decision and you may find the following questions helpful.

* How many attorneys do I want to appoint?
* Are these people willing to act? Have I discussed my LPA fully with them?
* Do they understand the role and responsibilities of an attorney?
* Do I trust them to act in my best interests?
* Do they know me, my beliefs and my preferences well enough to make decisions on my behalf?
* Do they have the skills to act under my LPA, and do they manage their own affairs well? (Are they good with money, for example?)

Remember, **you also need to decide if you need replacement attorneys**.
