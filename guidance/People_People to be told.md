# People to be told

**'People to be told' are the individuals you choose to be notified** when you apply to register your LPA.

## Why tell people?

Letting people know about your LPA when it's about to be registered provides extra security. It helps to make sure that you haven't been put under pressure to make the LPA. And **people who know you well get a chance to raise any concerns**.

This safeguard can be especially important if there's a big gap between making your LPA and registering it.

You don't have to choose people to be told. However, if you don't, you'll need 2 people – known as certificate providers – instead of 1, to confirm that you've made the LPA of your own free will. See our [Certificate providers](#/help/certificate-providers) help topic to find our more.

## Who you can choose

You can choose up to 5 'people to be told', but **they can't be your attorneys or replacement attorneys**. Many donors choose family members or close friends.

It's a good idea to talk to the people before you name them and to explain that:

* they don't have to do anything right away
* they will only be notified when an application to register your LPA is made
* they do not have to do anything then either, unless they have concerns

### Questions to ask yourself

* Do I want anyone to be notified when I or my attorneys apply to register my LPA?
* Have I discussed what's involved with my 'people to be told'?
* Do they understand why I want to name them and what will happen if an application to register my LPA is made?
* Are they happy to be named in my LPA?

## How the people are told

Just before you apply to register your LPA, you must send each of the 'people to be told' a form to let them know about the LPA. **You can download this form** during the process of registration in this tool. If your attorneys apply to register your LPA, they must do the same.

The form sets out reasons why people can object. It also tells them how to object.

## Where there are no concerns

If the notified people have no concerns then **they don't have to say or do anything**.

## Where there are grounds for objection

If a 'person to be told' does want to raise concerns about your LPA, they have 3 weeks to do so from the date they were notified.

**There are rules about the sort of concerns people can raise.** They can't object to your LPA simply because they don't like the idea of it. People can only object to the registration of an LPA on what are known as 'factual grounds' or 'prescribed grounds.'

### Factual grounds

A 'person to be told' can object to the Office of the Public Guardian against registration of the LPA if:

* you or an attorney has died
* you and an attorney were married or had a civil partnership and that relationship has been legally ended
* an attorney doesn't have the mental capacity to be an attorney
* an attorney has decided to stop acting (known as 'disclaiming their appointment')
* you or an attorney are bankrupt or interim bankrupt, or subject to a debt relief order (this applies to property and financial affairs LPAs only)


### Prescribed grounds

A 'person to be told' can object to the Court of Protection against registration of the LPA if:

* the power purported to be created by the LPA is not valid as an LPA – if they don't believe you had the capacity to make an LPA, for example
* the power created by the LPA no longer exists – if you, the donor, revoked it at a time when you had mental capacity
* there was fraud, or undue pressure on you to make the LPA
* an attorney proposes to behave in a way that would go beyond their authority, or would not be in your best interests
