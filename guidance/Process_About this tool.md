# About this tool
This digital LPA tool helps you make your lasting power of attorney (LPA).

**You'll be taken through a set of questions**. At each question you need to give some information or make choices. You'll also find links to detailed guidance if you need it. You can **stop at any time and save the information you've entered so far**. You may want to do this if you need to think about a decision or discuss your LPA with someone. Just sign back in when you're ready.

Please note that with this digital tool:

* **you can't complete the whole process online** – you'll need to print and sign your LPA and send it off to be registered
* **you can't make an LPA that can be registered anywhere other than England and Wales** – your LPA may not be recognised in other jurisdictions

Make sure you have access to a printer. You'll need to print out your completed LPA document so that you and the other people involved can sign it. The law says that an LPA must be a paper document with hand-written signatures or marks.

Please note that if you're not able to sign or make a mark yourself, you can direct someone else to sign on your behalf.

## The 3 steps

* **Create**: make decisions about your LPA and choose the people you want to be involved. Print out your completed LPA document
* **Sign**: make sure all the required people sign your LPA document in the correct order
  * See [Signing the LPA](#/help/signing-the-lpa)
* **Apply to register**: fill in some more details and pay the application fee, then send the documents to the Office of the Public Guardian (OPG)
  * See [Registering your LPA](#/help/registering-the-lpa)

It's a good idea to apply to **register your LPA sooner rather than later**. That way any mistakes which could make it invalid can be put right before it's registered. And then your LPA will be ready to use as soon as you need it.

## Before you begin

You need to make quite a few decisions when you make your LPA. You should think about these decisions in advance. It's important to know how your LPA will work and to talk to the people you want to be involved.

### Questions to ask yourself

* Who do I want to be my **attorneys**? (These are the people who act on your behalf under the LPA.)
* How many attorneys do I need?
* Should I have **replacement attorneys** too? (These are people who step in if original attorneys can no longer act, so they're a way to protect your LPA.)
* **How should my attorneys make decisions** on my behalf? Should they act together or individually, or a mixture of the two?
* Are there any **restrictions and conditions** I want to place on the way my attorneys make decisions?
* Is there any **guidance** I want to give about how I would prefer my attorneys to make decisions?
* Who's the independent person – the **certificate provider** – who can make sure you understand your LPA and that no-one is forcing you to make it? (This person acts as a safeguard and can raise concerns when you make your LPA.)
* Are there any **'people to be told'** about my LPA when it is about to be registered? (These people act as a safeguard, as they can raise concerns about your LPA before it can be used.)
