# Fees, reductions and exemptions

There is a **£110 application fee** for each LPA you apply to register. However, if the donor has a very low income or gets certain benefits **you can pay a lower fee or no fee**. 


## Do I qualify for a lower fee or no fee?

It is **only the donor** whose benefits and income matter.

* If the donor receives certain **means-tested benefits** you **may not have to pay anything** (called an 'exemption'). 

* If the donor has an **annual income of less than £12,000** you will be entitled to a **50% reduction** (called a 'remission').

* If the donor receives **Universal Credit**, you may also be entitled to a remission. We'll assess the level of remission when we receive your application. 

If the application is being made by an attorney, the attorney's financial circumstances aren't taken into account. 

The attorney can pay the fee and reclaim it from the donor's funds.

### Which benefits qualify for an exemption?

If the donor receives any of the following means-tested benefits you won't have to pay a fee:

* Income Support
* Income-based Employment and Support Allowance 
* Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance
* Guarantee Credit element of State Pension Credit
* a combination of Working Tax Credit and at least one of:
	* Child Tax Credit
	* Disability Element of Working Tax Credit
	* Severe Disability Element of Working Tax Credit 
* Housing Benefit
* Council Tax Reduction (not the 25% single person reduction or the Class U exemption) or Council Tax Support
* Local Housing Allowance.

The Disability Living Allowance, Invalidity Benefit and Personal Independence Pay **won't** qualify the donor for an exemption.

If the donor has been awarded **personal injury damages of more than £16,000** and the damages were ignored when they were assessed for the benefit, you **will not qualify** for an exemption from paying fees.

### What proof do you need to send in for an exemption?

You have to prove that the donor receives one of the relevant benefits. Your proof should be a copy of **a recent letter from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) or another relevant benefit provider** confirming that they receive benefits.

The letter must confirm that the benefit was being paid to the donor **at the time the LPA was sent to us for registration.** It should include their printed details – their title, full name, address and postcode.

Send the proof to us along with the **LPA document**, your **application to register** and the **application for remission forms**.

### How do you qualify for remission of fees?

If you – the donor – have a **gross annual income of less than £12,000** you will be eligible for a **50% reduction** of the fee.

Gross annual income is income before tax. It's not just salary or wages – it may come from a range of sources, such as: 

* non-means-tested benefits (such as Attendance Allowance and Disability Living Allowance)
* pensions 
* interest from capital investments
* rental income from property

### What proof do you need to send in for remission of fees?

You'll have to send documents that prove you have a low income. Examples of proof can include copies of: 

* 3 months' consecutive wage slips, or a P60 
* statements from a pension provider 
* a recent tax return if you're self-employed
* An official letter or notice from the payer of non-means-tested benefits
* statements or vouchers showing interest from capital, stocks, shares or bonds

The proof should cover a period of **three months or more**. It should be pre-printed with the donor's title, full name, address and postcode.

If the donor receives no income, they'll have to send us a signed statement explaining how they support themselves. 

You will have to send us the proof of income along with the  **LPA document**, your **application to register** and the **application for remission forms**.

### Universal Credit

If you – the donor – receive Universal Credit (UC), you may also qualify for a reduction. 

Because UC is in its trial phase and replaces several existing benefits, we'll have to look at your application individually before we can say how much of the fee you'll have to pay.  

This means that **you won't be charged through this tool** for your application. It will still create all the documents you need, but you won't be asked to pay.

Once your **LPA document**, your **application to register** and the **application for remission forms** are signed and dated, send them to us along with a copy of your **benefit award letter**.

Once we've received everything, we'll contact you to let you know how much you'll have to pay and to arrange payment. We aim to do this within 7 working days of receiving an application.
