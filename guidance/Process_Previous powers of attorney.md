# Previous powers of attorney

We need to know if the donor has any other registered LPAs or any Enduring Powers of Attorney (EPAs). This is so we can check some details about those earlier powers of attorney. For instance, we have to make sure that a certificate provider on one isn't an attorney on another â€“ this isn't allowed.

If you have made a power of attorney before, please use the text box in this section of the tool to give us any information that will help us to locate your records. This could include a reference number, the donor's name or the date of registration.
