# Certificate providers

A certificate provider is **an independent person** who confirms that you understand what you're doing and that nobody is forcing you to do it.

If you also name 'people to be told', you need 1 certificate provider.

If you **don't** name 'people to be told', you need 2 certificate providers.

You might want to take a look at our [People to be told](/help/#topic-people-to-be-told) help topic too.

## A certificate provider's role
A certificate provider helps to make sure that all's well when you make your LPA, and acts as an important safeguard. They must confirm that:

* you understand the significance of the LPA
* you have not been put under pressure to make it
* there has been no fraud involved in making the LPA
* there is no other reason for concern

If possible **they should discuss your LPA with you in private**, without attorneys or other people present, before they sign to 'certify' their part of the LPA.

## Who can be a certificate provider?
A certificate provider must be 18 or over and either:

* someone who has known you well personally for at least 2 years, or
* someone with the relevant professional skills and expertise to be able to confirm the things listed above

Note that **'people to be told' can also act as certificate providers**.

### Someone who has known you well for at least 2 years

If you want to choose someone who has known you well for at least 2 years, you should ask **a friend or neighbour, someone you know at a social or sports club, a work colleague**, or similar. They can't be a member of your family or of an attorney's family.

**They must be more than an acquaintance**. They have to know you well enough to have an honest conversation with you about making your LPA and to be able to satisfy themselves about the things they have to confirm when they sign the LPA.

### Someone with relevant professional skills

If you want to choose someone with relevant
professional skills, they must be one of the following:

* a registered healthcare professional, such as your GP
* a solicitor, barrister or advocate
* a registered social worker
* an Independent Mental Capacity Advocate (IMCA)
* someone else who has professional skills that enable them to judge whether you can make the decisions you need to make for your LPA

## People who can't be certificate providers
The certificate provider **must not be**:

* an attorney or replacement attorney for the LPA
* an attorney or replacement attorney appointed under any other LPA or enduring power of attorney you have made
* a member of your family or of one of your attorneys' families, including spouses, civil partners, in-laws and step-relatives
* an unmarried partner, boyfriend or girlfriend of either you or any of your attorneys (whether or not they live at the same address)
* your business partner or an attorney's business partner
* your employee or an attorney's employee
* an owner, manager, director or employee of a care home where you live, or a member of their family
* anyone running or working for a trust corporation appointed as an attorney in this LPA
* any other person who the Court of Protection may consider is not sufficiently independent

## Explaining how the person is qualified
When you fill in the digital form you'll be asked to tick one of the following to explain how the certificate provider knows you:

> I'd rather they filled in this part of the LPA themselves

> They have known the donor well personally for at least 2 years

> They have relevant professional skills and expertise

If you pick the second or third option, you'll need to add details in one of the free-text boxes provided. Otherwise, the certificate provider will fill in these details on the LPA document when they sign it.

### Details to write in the box
If they know you well personally, clearly state how, eg "friend", "neighbour" or "colleague".  This is more important than stating how many years they have known you. It's a common mistake to say something like "I've known the donor for 20 years." This doesn't explain your relationship.

The certificate provider will have to sign this statement on the printed LPA, so write it from their point of view: for instance, "I have been a colleague of the donor for 3 years." or "I've lived next door to (your name) for 8 years".

If they have relevant professional skills and experience, clearly state what they are. If they have relevant specialist training or experience as part of their profession, they should mention that too.

### Questions to ask yourself

* Has the person known me well for at least 2 years?
* If the person does not know me well personally, do they have the professional skills to make a judgement about my ability to make an LPA?
* Is the person excluded from being a certificate provider because they have a close family or working relationship with either me or one of my attorneys?
* Have I named any 'people to be told'? (If not, remember that you'll need 2 certificate providers instead of 1.)
