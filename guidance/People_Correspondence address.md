# Correspondence address

The Office of the Public Guardian (OPG) **will contact the person named here** about the progress of an application to register your LPA.

## Who can be the correspondent?

The correspondent can be:

* the applicant (who could be you as the donor, or one of your attorneys)
* a solicitor or other legal professional
* someone else who you'd prefer to receive correspondence from OPG

There can only be one correspondent for each LPA application.

## Why we might make contact
OPG may need to get in touch with the correspondent so that we can:

* pass on information about the progress of an application
* ask a question about your LPA

## Where is the registered LPA sent?
OPG will send your registered LPA to the person who applied to register that LPA â€“ the applicant. The exception is if you choose a legal professional to act as correspondent, in which case they'll receive the registered LPA instead of the applicant.
