# Paying attorneys: fees and expenses

If your attorneys don't need to be paid, you should leave this box empty. 

Many attorneys don't receive fees. For example, if you appoint your spouse, a family member or a friend, they may be happy to act on your behalf without being paid. However, some professional attorneys, like solicitors or accountants, charge for their services. 

Fees are paid out of your funds.

You can set different fees for different attorneys. For non-professional attorneys these are often set as a payment per year. 

If you agree to pay a fee to a non-professional, **it must be specified here**, otherwise the attorney cannot be paid.

Regardless of whether they are paid fees, all attorneys can claim reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, such as postage costs, travel costs and paying an accountant for preparing annual accounts. You do not have to specify the payment of expenses here. Expenses, like fees, are paid out of your funds. 

### Examples of setting fees

Here's how you might fill in this section if you have non-professional attorneys:

> I wish each of my attorneys to be paid Â£xxxx per year for their services under this LPA.

You can set a professional attorney's fee by reference to standard rates:

> I wish my professional attorneys to be paid the standard solicitor rate as set by [a professional body].

You can specify that your attorneys are not to be paid or are only to be paid expenses if you like, but it is not necessary.
