# Witnesses
Witnesses are **people who see you and your attorneys (including any replacements) sign your LPA**. Witnesses must also sign the LPA to confirm that it was signed in their presence.

**When you, as the donor, sign Part A** of the LPA document your signature must be witnessed. Please note that if you're not able to sign or make a mark yourself, someone else can sign on your behalf. You'll need to add a special 'continuation sheet' to your LPA for them to sign.

**When your attorneys sign Part C** of the LPA document their signatures must be witnessed.

## Who can be an independent witness?
Independent witnesses must be 18 or over.

**For your (the donor's) signature**, the witness must be independent. As long as they are sufficiently independent, the witness could be a certificate provider or a ‘person to be told’. **An attorney or replacement attorney can’t be your witness**. Nor can the employee of any trust corporation named as an attorney or replacement attorney. [J&E please confirm this is full and accurate position]

**For attorneys’ signatures**, another attorney, a replacement attorney, a certificate provider, a 'person to be told' or another independent person can be a witness. [J&E - Guidance pdf doesn't say people to be told but form does. Please confirm position and if we need anything further here] **You, the donor, can't be a witness for your attorneys' signatures**.

The same independent person can witness both donor and attorney signatures, assuming they are not an attorney themselves.[J&E - ok?]

[J&E - I've added 'another independent person' in both instances - is this ok? The pdf I've referenced doesn't say this but I would have thought this was the case as both the cert provider and people to be told may not be fully 'independent']
