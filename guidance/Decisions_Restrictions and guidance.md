# Restrictions and guidance

You can place restrictions and conditions on your attorneys and give them guidance.

**Restrictions and conditions**
> These are certain **things your attorneys must or must not do**, or procedures they **must** follow when making decisions

**Guidance**
> This covers things **you would like your attorneys to think about** when making decisions. Your attorneys should take your guidance into account but **they don't have to follow it**.

You don't have to include restrictions or guidance in your LPA. If you've appointed attorneys who you trust to make good decisions on your behalf, you probably won't need restrictions or guidance.

### Help with restrictions and guidance

Complicated or badly phrased restrictions and guidance can make an LPA unworkable. It may not be registered or may need to go to the Court of Protection to be changed. In that case the restrictions will be 'severed' – that is, effectively removed from the LPA. This is a time-consuming process.

In the information below you'll find examples of mistakes that donors sometimes make when drawing up restrictions and guidance. You'll also see a few acceptable restrictions and guidance that will work in many common situations.

If you're not sure about what you can include and how to complete this section of the LPA, you may want to get legal advice.

## More about restrictions and conditions

Restrictions and conditions are things that your attorneys **must or must not do**, or procedures they must follow, when making decisions on your behalf under your LPA.

If you leave this blank, your attorneys will be free to make these decisions as they see fit.

### Property and finance restrictions
For a **property and financial affairs LPA**, this is a good chance to add **additional safeguards** relating to your attorneys' decisions. For example:

* a condition that they give annual accounts to a third party, such as an accountant
* a condition that they seek professional advice on certain decisions

### Health and welfare restrictions
For a **health and welfare LPA**, you can use this section to specify procedures that must be followed. For example:

* a restriction on certain medical treatments that are against your religion
* a condition about types of care, such as diet, that conflict with your beliefs

Use words like **'must'**, **'shall'** and **'have to'** if you write restrictions.

The section on mistakes, below, explains the kind of things you can't make your attorneys do. If you would like your attorneys to do something that you are not allowed to include as a restriction, you may be able to include it as guidance instead.

## Mistakes to avoid when making restrictions and conditions

### Contradictions to do with decision-making
The most common error is appointing attorneys to make decisions in one way, then including a restriction that requires them to act differently.

So, if you have decided your attorneys should act jointly and severally – they can make any decision on your behalf on their own or together – you **can't then add restrictions like the following**:

* that they must make some decisions together – you should **appoint them to act 'jointly for some decisions, and jointly and severally for other decisions' instead** if this is what you want
* that 1 attorney has to defer to another
* that 1 attorney must deal with your business and another with your private affairs
* that where attorneys disagree, the majority should prevail

You can often **use guidance rather than restrictions** to express this sort of wish.

If you have decided your attorneys should act jointly – they must agree unanimously on every decision – you can't then say that if 1 dies, the others can continue to act.

In short, **don't appoint attorneys to make decisions in 1 way, then include a restriction that requires them to act differently.**

### Gifts can cause trouble
Restrictions concerning **gifts often cause problems**. There are strict limits on the kinds of gifts attorneys can give on your behalf. They can give presents on 'customary occasions' – weddings, birthdays, religious holidays and so on. They can also donate to charities you've previously given money to. Any gifts should be 'reasonable' and take into account how much money you have.

**You can't authorise attorneys to go beyond these limits**. Here are some kinds of **gifts you can't authorise**:

* gifts intended to reduce inheritance tax liability
* trust funds for grandchildren
* payment of school fees for grandchildren
* interest-free loans to family
* maintenance for any family member other than your spouse, civil partner or child under 18

Your attorney must apply to the Court of Protection if they want to make gifts like this on your behalf.

### Other mistakes
Here are some other areas where people often make mistakes:

* you can't tell your attorneys to do anything against the law – this includes anything to do with euthanasia and assisted suicide
* you can't say that attorneys should act in the best interests of your spouse or child – your attorneys act for you, not for someone else
* you can't say a replacement attorney can only start acting in specific circumstances (see our [Replacement attorneys](#/help/replacement-attorneys) help topic). For instance, you can't use restrictions to add special circumstances – like an original attorney being on holiday – in which your replacement attorney can step in
* don't add restrictions about health and welfare to a property and financial affairs LPA. Don't add restrictions about property and financial affairs to a health and welfare LPA. You should make a separate LPA for each instead
* you can't tell an attorney to change your will – it's outside their powers
* you can't give an attorney power to appoint a substitute or successor attorney


## Examples of workable restrictions and conditions

Here are some restrictions that you might add to a **property and financial affairs LPA**:

> My attorneys must continue to make donations to charities that I have previously supported or for which I have set up standing order payments.

> My attorneys must not make any gifts.

> My attorneys must not sell my home unless, in my doctor's opinion, I can no longer live independently.

> My attorneys must send annual accounts to my brothers and sisters.

> My attorneys must instruct a tax accountant to prepare my annual tax return.

And here are restrictions suitable for a **health and welfare LPA**:

> My attorneys must ensure that I am only given vegetarian food.

> I consent to the disclosure to my attorneys of all relevant information concerning me.

> My attorneys must not consent to any medical treatment involving blood products, as this would be against my religion.

> My attorneys must not decide that I am to move into residential care unless, in my doctor's opinion, I can no longer live independently.

These are just a few examples. You can make restrictions and conditions about other things.


## More about guidance

Guidance tells your attorneys about your wishes, beliefs and preferences – **things you'd like them to think about** when acting under your LPA. Your **attorneys don't have to follow guidance**, but they should keep it in mind when making decisions on your behalf.

In a **property and financial affairs LPA**, the guidance might include:

* your views on ethical investments
* how your bank accounts should be managed – how much should be in your current account, for instance
* instructions concerning taxes

In a **health and welfare LPA**, the guidance might include:

* your views on different medical treatments
* where you would like to live
* your preferred care workers

You do not have to give any guidance. Your attorneys should be people you trust. If they understand your beliefs and values then you may feel there is no need for further guidance in the LPA.

If you would like your attorneys to do something that you are not allowed to include as a restriction or condition, you can sometimes include it in guidance.

For guidance, **avoid words like 'must' and 'shall'**. Instead **use words like 'prefer' and 'would like'**, so it is clear that you are giving your attorneys advice but not instructions. If there is anything you definitely want your attorneys to do, then it should be included in the restrictions and conditions.

## Examples of guidance

Here's some guidance that could be used in a **property and financial affairs LPA**:

> I would like to maintain a minimum balance of £1,000 in my current account.

> I prefer to invest in ethical funds.

> I would like my attorneys to consult my doctor if they believe I may not have mental capacity to make decisions about my house.

> I would like to donate £100 each year to Age UK.

And this is the kind of guidance that could be used in a **health and welfare LPA**:

> I prefer to live within 5 miles of my sister.

> I prefer to be prescribed generic medicine whenever possible.

> I would like to take exercise at least three times a week whenever I am physically able to do so.

> My attorneys should consult my family when making decisions about life-sustaining treatment.

The last of these would only apply if you chose to allow your attorneys to make decisions about life-sustaining treatment.
